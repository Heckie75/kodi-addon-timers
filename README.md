Powerful timers for KODI

I wanted to have a KODI addon that is a sleep timer, a doze timer, has several other timer slots and combines it with fading volume in and out over a certain period. Since I haven't found it I decided to program it by myself.

The result is a powerful timer addon.

## Overview of features:
* Unlimited timer slots. All of them can be quickly set up by using context menu
* single-click-setup for sleep and doze timers
* Timers can play any resource that it available in KODI, e.g. music folders, video files, TV/radio programs, slideshows, resources from 3rd party plugins, e.g. Zattoo channels.
* Timers can be set from TV / Radio EPG, One-click-setup from epg (Quick Timer)
* Different schedule modes: once, everyday, Mon-Fri, Fri-Sat, Sat-Sun, Sun-Thu, Mon-Thu, specific weekday and many more
* Date change is supported, e.g. from 23:30 (p.m.) until 1:30 (a.m.)
* Shuffle, repeat, 2 end modes, i.e. duration or specific time
* Actions related to media: start media and stop at end, just start media, start media at end, stop media immediately, stop media at end, power down system
* Linear fading in timer period: fade-in, fade-out, no fading. Min and max volume can be set for each timer
* Custom label for timer
* After KODI startup timers, that are in period, start retroactively although KODI was not running at start time. Fading volume is calculated correctly.
* Feature in order to prevent that display is turned off if KODI idles but is not in full screen mode
* MS Windows only: Feature in order to prevent that Windows displays lock screen if KODI idles
